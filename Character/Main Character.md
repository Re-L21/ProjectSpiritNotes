## Key Points

- Works for the Agency (see below).
- MC “saves” spirits instead of exorcising them.
- Ideas for the reasons of MC saving spirits instead of exorcising?
	- To crack the case of the mystery and find resolution for the spirit. Exorcising spirits might be faster but it doesn't solve the mystery.
	- MC is searching for something or someone, but the only way to find whatever that is, is to solve every spirit case one by one.
- Spirits reside inside/on the mc's body:
	- Either on a tattoo to mark where the spirit can stay
	- Or the spirit manifests as the tattoo itself
- MC collects mementos from spirits.
- Growing marks/scars around his body due to corruption.
- MC always solves anything with ==questionable== methods.
- Sometimes ends up causing new problems whenever he fixes a problem. (for comedy purposes).
- Good at fighting but not the smartest one in the team.
- Flat expression most of the time (trying to be cool) but goofy af.
- Ryan Gosling meme when dealing with a real woman.
- Looks scary to everyone around him.
