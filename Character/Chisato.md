## Backstory Ideas

1. A night shift nurse that experienced a painful accident, her leg got stuck between the elevators when the elevator was about to move so she could only drag her leg to look for help in a hospital that was empty of people.

2. A doctor practicing in a remote area receives an urgent call in the middle of the night. The patient is someone close and important to her, in desperate need of immediate attention. On her way to help, the doctor tragically dies in a car accident.
